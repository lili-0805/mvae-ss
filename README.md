# FastMVAE2: On improving and accelerating the fast variational autoencoder-based source separation algorithm for determined mixtures

This repository provides official PyTorch implementation of multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) and its fast algorithms proposed in the following papers. The MVAE algorithm in this repo is the same as that previously provided at https://github.com/lili-0805/MVAE.

We also provide pretrained models for speaker-closed and speaker-open situations trained using VCC and WSJ0 datasets, respectively.

## Dependencies

Code was tested using following packages. 
A full package list is in requirements.txt.

* Python 3.6.6
* PyTorch 1.10.2
* Scipy 1.5.4
* Numpy 1.19.5

## Download
Get code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lili-0805/mvae-ss.git
```

Using download script to download training dataset, test dataset, and pretrained models.

The test samples were generated using the VCC dataset. Namely, the test samples are speaker-closed for models trained using the VCC dataset, and speaker-open for models trained using the WSJ0 dataset.

Considering the license of WSJ0 database, we do not provide training dataset of WSJ0. Please download WSJ0 database and prepare trainging dataset described in our paper #2 by yourselves. 

```bash
$ cd mvae-ss/exe
$ bash download.sh dataset-VCC
$ bash download.sh test-samples
$ bash download.sh models
```

## Usage

Please use stage to choose model training or test, where stage=0 and stage=1 indicate training and test, respectively.

The following command is the default setting for training ChimeraACVAE source model with the VCC dataset and then testing the trained model with FastMVAE2 algorithm on the downloaded test dataset.

```bash
$ ./run.sh --stage 0 --stop_stage 1 --algorithm FastMVAE2 --dataset vcc --test_mode trained --test_dataset test_input
```

More details are available in the `run.sh` bash file.
